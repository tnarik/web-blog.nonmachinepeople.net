# Gloomhaven tools

I used to keep a file with references to a bunch of tools to support playing Jaws of the Lion, Gloomhaven and ideally Frosthaven. but that file is empty now (not sure what I did, probably messed up and just didn't save). regardless, this is my attempt to recreate this list as I want to complete the JotL campaing and start a new one.


# Frosthaven tools

there is an [official FAQ in Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3001013/official-faq-frosthaven-no-rules-questions-please), which I found while looking for the differences between the Kickstarter Frosthaven (which I have) and the 2nd printing from 2023 (being shipped in 2024). there is also an [errata](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3066140/frosthaven-assets-faqerrata-and-asset-modification/page/1). a quick summary of the errata/changes can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3002178/unofficial-five-minute-guide-incorporating-fh-erra), taking into account what is important vs what are minor typos or labelling errors.

# *haven tools
