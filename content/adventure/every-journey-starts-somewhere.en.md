\<Blobo\> is a \<Hill or Moountain\> Dwarf. He has been raised by a farming human couple (Krogg and Portclia Ephenbald), living quite far away from other towns or settlements. the couple lived in a long and narrow glen, a dead-end valley surrounded by tall mountains, about a 4 hour walk through hard terrain from the end of the valley. life was hard there and the weather extreme at times, but for some reason they decided to settle there and were usually left alone. they were not unfriendly but were mostly self-sufficient and didn't visit the closest village (really just a sparse group of farmhouse) often, perhaps 4 times a year, mostly just Krogg to barter and keep in touch.
one night after a week of heavy Winter storms, the Sun finally broke through and they woke up to find a landslide occurred on one of the furthest slopes, not putting in danger their settlement, their crops, nor the main stream of water for the valley. 

worried about xxxxxxxxx, and knowing the weather would stand for a couple of days, Krogg decided to investigate immediately, packed some tools and overnight gear, and approached the head of the landslide. made his way higher up to check xxxxxx and saw everything was ok and there was no urgency ( he could use springtime to make yyyyy a bit better). took refuge in a cave further up and started a campfire for the night, instead of risking going back at night.

he was reading while heating some rations. the night sounded a bit strange that day, the same animal sounds as usual but more cautious even than when he was hunting, some animals clearly unsettled but perhaps also on the prowl, or just afraid and nervous. nothing that should worry him ( there was no lack of food in the area, he was far from burrows, dens or breeding grounds, and anyway had his trusted bow with him). but there was another sound. the sound of someone falling and weeping, moving through wet soil at times. some metal clanking. then what seemed like two words maffled out of breath and energy: “de?” (mother?), “pai?” (father?). also some sharp yelps. a somewhat high-pitched voice, albeit hoarse, the noise becoming closer and clearer.

carefully, Krogg approached the lip of the cave, his bow in the hand and ready, but not charged nor raised. squinting into the dark he saw a child, wrapped in furs, a belt with some metal reinforcements, a golden chain hanging from his neck. looking tired, dirty and clearly in distress, the kid he was limping a bit, all limbs on the ground, scrambling up towards the light.

Krogg went back to the cave, left the bow, grabbed a burning stick, and went back to fetch the kid. as soon as he appeared again on the lip, this time clearly visible and noisy ("hey, kid!"), \<Blobo\> froze, unsure. Krogg showed his hands, using his calmer voice. "hey, kid. do you need help? are you ok?" "where are your folks?". seconds of silence. 10 meters away, the kid looked frightened but also hopeful, needy. "de? pai?", some other words (perhaps help? hunger? dirty?). Krogg moved closer, the kid startled, moved to scramble sideways, slipped and fell hurting his leg further. he fell down crying, with some words in what sounded like Dwarvish (Krogg didn't know the language, but that's how he thought it would sound). Got closer, slowly, the torch held up to one side, so that it lighted his path, his face and the kid. speaking reassuringly and constantly, friendly and calm. he got close to the kid and stretched one hand, offering it to the kid. the kid was shivering, probably thirsty and hungry. the leg didn't seem broken but there was some blood. "it's ok, I can help, there is water and food up there. shelter. let me help you." the kid seemed a bit calmer, but inquiring, not fully trusting him. sobbing the kid looked into his eyes, the face behind the visible breath, didn't as much make a decision as just follow an instinct. he grabbed Krogg's hand as support, Krogg helped the kid up, they got to the cave (not carried, helped), where he ate and drank. \<Blobo/\> spoke no words at all, and Krogg didn't expect any, just talked about how he was safe now, and he would find out what happened after some rest. the kid eyes seemed grateful but also uncertain, but he allowed the inspection of his leg. nothing looked broken, but there was a big scrape and some bruising, swollen and red. Krogg chew some herbs, applied them. the kid collapsed tired but now warm, and Krogg made plans for the next day.

there is more to tell about that night and the following days, but essentially Krogg took the kid back home in the morning (the kid woke up when he greeted Portclia). got the kid in, realised he was suffering from some infection. after talking to Portclia, Krogg went out again to try to find out what happened. following the kids steps from the cave he got to some boxes and supplies, unorderly in the border of the landslide. investigated further and saw a what looked like parts of a carriage, also the remains of two ponies, half buried and suffocated, some bones broken. didn't find the carriage, didn't find any corpse. Krogg understood there was an accident due to the landslide, and the carriage tumbled down and was sepulted, probably there under tons of soil and rocks, perhaps with the bodies of whoever was with the kid (his parents, Krogg assumed).

\<Blobo\> has been told all this, he doesn't remember that well as he was 3 years old and traumatised/shaken at the time. plus at 3 year old memories are foggy. Krogg and Porclia were on their 30s.

from then, the couple took care of him. \<Blobo\> recovered and learnt to speak Common. during the next year Krogg went a couple of times trying to find out more, usually as part of his hunting trips. when \<Blobo\> was older he went with him, and then also on his own. never found much, perhaps pieces of wood, some ornate metal work, the carcasses of the ponies.

there was not known mountain pass on that valley (that was one of the reasons whey Krogg and Portclia settled there without issues), so the provenance of the kid was a bit of a mistery. there were no Dwarf settlements around, no commercial trade over the mountains, there haven't been any conflict there in ages. when they went back to the village, they tried to find out if there were any news, or some old lore about passes, Dwarfs, but nobody knew anything. with time they introduced \<Blobo\> as their kid (as an adopted kid), giving a short version of the story, so the rest of the valley was aware \<Blobo\> was a dwarf and not just a sturdy, shorter human kid. they called him \<Blobo\> Ephenbald (nobody spoke Dwarvish in the area and \<Blobo\> didn't know his surname). he was raised as a human kid (neither the family nor the villagers had any knowledge of Dwarven traditions), and he shaved, drank wine.

the only things \<Blobo\> kept from this time are a wooden toy and the golden chain. he also has a small box with scraps he managed to get together from the accident. nothing that was providing a clear clue about his origin.

\<Blobo\> stayed with the Ephenbald until he was 36 (when they were roughly 63). the last couple of years he was talking care of them.
