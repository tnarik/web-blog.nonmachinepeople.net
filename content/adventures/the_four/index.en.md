# The Four

## Intro

I've been wanting to play some solo RPGs for a while now, and I've been doing it in some fashion by playing around with game books, fantasy based 1 player tabletop (or traytop) games, and some scripted solo adventures (like Obvious Mimic or Archmage Press 5e solo adventures). some of those plays are more thorough than others, while some are more paused, depending on the time I have.

what I was planning on trying for some time is a simplified unscripted dungeon crawler (not exactly an RPG, except in the OSR sense of it, as represented by `pedit5`, which [I talked about before]({{< relref "posts/crpg-archaeology" >}}) )

I started looking into it a long time ago, reading and re-reading the book (or portions of it), but now I am finally pushing for a first run. with already selected character names and archetypes from some months ago (during a trip or perhaps a break from climbing), the only thing pending is to start playing. for this, I printed some pages and booklets at work, and I will also keep track of them here, at least as snapshots.
