# The Second Four

## first, a look back...

after the [previous adventure]({{< relref "adventures/the_four" >}}) I got some time to think about what I learned (or could have learned). there are some rules that I definitely didn't follow (and knew about, but decided to continue ignoring for consistency) both in the RAW (rule as written) and RAI (rule as intended) sense. at least as far as I know. one of those was using the `Protect` spell for save checks, and another was regarding considering a Boss as outnumbered to apply benefits to the rogue (**Pettic**). in the end it didn't matter because the fight ended horribly, from a win/loss point of vieve (I was actually very pleased with the outcome).

since then (while preparing for my time in Sitges, yay!) I re-read the rules (fully on the plain today), and also compiled my doubts (either because of how they are written or unclared ambiguity). there are:
* a group in Facebook, **Four Against Darkness Adventurer's Guild** (I refuse to link Facebook, but you can search for it), where the creator (**Andrea Sfiligoi**) contributes and answers doubts often
* a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ganeshagames), which I found about recently
* a [BoardGameGeek forum](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197097/four-against-darkness/forums/), with a [Rules section](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197097/four-against-darkness/forums/66), where [**Dafrca**](https://boardgamegeek.com/profile/dafrca) does a wonderful work addressing doubts and bringing a consolidated view of rules. I have no clue how involved they are in 4AD, but if they are just a fan, they are working greatly on behalf of the community.

mainly the last source was very useful for me to refine some of my questions (at least for the core game). they might not be big things, but coming from an engineering background I like to know how things are MEANT to be, even if I might end up tweaking them. "have fun" should always be the main rule for non-competitive gaming, I reckon, and homebrews contribute to that (your fun cannot be wrong, unless it harms somebody).

one of those rules I now understand better has to do with the 6 as an automated success, and how to combine that with the exploding die rule. apparently, in the newer version (I might buy that), the exploding die applies to attacks, defences and saves. IMHO that makes sense, because it is somehow similar to the auto-success but it integrates better across dice rolls. I will apply that.

anyway, with an updated understanding in my head, I reviewed my strategy (things I didn't do, things I did too much of), and I will try to use that knowledge on a new session (which was meant to happen tonight, but tomorrow there is an early screening, of course). I will add at least some notes about that newer session. 

the main thing might be that I will try to keep track of everything in a single page of the XL softcover Moleskine that I used a few times to support/store/save games. a bit smaller than a DIN A4 page. the goal is to avoid having multiple pages, or having to print.

a second point is that I will try to reduce the amount of in-the-moment writing happening. as good as it could be, going back and forth between a paper/map/die and the computer breaks the flow. the laptop will probably be nearby anyway, but instead of recording everything going on here, it will go on the paper first (I saw a video where a map was annotated via footnotes, which I think would work well).

the last point is that I will focus a bit more on survival (reduce risk), by not searching or going back so often. AND paying more attention to the preparation (bandages!), which I barely did with **The First Four**.

let's see. now, a quick intro.

## Intro

**Julienne** hasn't heard from **Pettic** in a couple of days. yes, he went adventuring into a dungeon, and this was meant to take some time. they were also not living together by any chance, and there are reasons why he might need to hide (fear of retaliation, paying some debts). perhaps the group were just celebrating, or licking their wounds or wounded pride.

this is the fourth night though ^[it really is, I started on the night of 2025-10-04, finishing on 2025-10-05, and today is the 8th]^ and she has been thinking about it since then ^[I have, although I know how that adventure ended]^. she had been holding on until now, hoping to get some information, clarity about what to do, but it is the time to do something. and not just her, but also **Remoura**. and perhaps some of her other friends.

she doesn't know exactly where to go, but she knows **Pettic** and his friends started from somewhere, so they will go to the same place, get ready and head towards **Pettic**'s most probable destination.

is it her business to adventure? no, she envisioned a different life for herself. but she has some skills for it, and **Pettic** is missing.

and she has motivated friends, joining her in the way. firstly, there is **Farluk**'s sister, **Remoura**. very different inclinations but still a concerned sister nevertheless.

the trio was also joined by a common friend of **Julienne** and **Pettic**, eager to support her on the search, either of his friend or of news about him. even if it meant retrieving his remains. *"whatever you need from me, **Julienne**. just ask"*, he said.

knowing Pettic and Farluk, the grouop assumes the lost party was impetuous and didn't prepare thoroughly. *"they were basically kids in search of fame and glory"* (and riches). instead of that, this search party has a goal: finding them. and they will not be reckless.

once they reached the last known place of reference, and gather some indications about they previous party goals, they rest for the night.
upon waking up, they pulled all their resources together and visited the main store/warehouse of the village. there they purchased:
* a lantern. definitely a must, dungeons are dark. **Remoura** doubts **Farluk** agreed on going ahead without one.
* bandages for all

## an entrance

following some indications from the village folks, they entered the forest and, after a while, found the double doors the barkeep mentioned. *"this might be it"*, said **Remoura** while sheathing her greatsword and pushing to open the doors. *"it certainly looks like it"*. the whole party joins to push and the doors open to an empty and quiet room, no signs of anybody (apparently). they enter.

their first encounter, zombies (Remoura and Cordelia do most)

a dart (Julienne avoids)

a trapdoor (Remoura falls)

some coins

3 zombies jump from the darkness (Porch hits them to death)

another empty room

5 skeletons, (Remoura and Cordelia do most DMG in 1 round)
