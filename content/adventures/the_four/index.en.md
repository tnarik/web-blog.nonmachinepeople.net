# The First Four

## Intro

I've been wanting to play some solo RPGs for a while now, and I've been doing it in some fashion by playing around with game books, fantasy based 1 player tabletop (or traytop) games, and some scripted solo adventures (like Obvious Mimic or Archmage Press 5e solo adventures). some of those plays are more thorough than others, while some are more paused, depending on the time I have.

what I was planning on trying for some time is a simplified unscripted dungeon crawler (not exactly an RPG, except in the OSR sense of it, as represented by `pedit5`, which [I talked about before]({{< relref "posts/crpg-archaeology" >}}) )

I started looking into it a long time ago, reading and re-reading the book (or portions of it), but now I am finally pushing for a first run. with already selected character names and archetypes from some months ago (during a trip or perhaps a break from climbing), the only thing pending is to start playing. for this, I printed some pages and booklets at work, and I will also keep track of some information here, at least as snapshots for the initial setup.

putting all the information together and finally rolling some dice, the party characters look like this: 

{{monster,frame
## Clovenia
*Warrior (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 7 (6 + L)
***Wealth*** :: 11 (2d6)
___
| Attack | Defense |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| +L (slashing) |    +1 +1   |
___
***armour*** :: Shield, light armour, heavy armour.
***weapons*** :: Any.
___
***attacks.*** :: L added to attack rolls.
### Items
***light armour.*** :: reinforced leather vest, pants and boots.
***shield.*** :: a heavy wooden shield, reinforced with metal bars and padded with fur.
***hand weapon.*** :: a fairly used broadsword.
}}

a warrior seems straightforward enough, with barely any decisions to make regarding their build. she will be the main damage dealer and tank, I guess.

{{monster,frame
## Farluk Farduk
*Wizzard (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 3 (2 + L)
***Wealth*** :: 16 (4d6)
___
| Attack | Defense |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| (+L)  or -1 (crushing) |       |
___
***armour*** :: None.
***weapons*** :: Light weapon, sling.
___
***attacks.*** :: L only added to attack rolls from spells (including scrolls).
***puzzles.*** :: L added to rolls to solve puzzles and riddles.
***spellcasting.*** :: A wizard begins with 2 + L spells. They should prepare then before starting the adventure (multiple copies are allowed). Additional spells (found or from leveling up), may be used immediately.  
### Spells
***Blessing.*** :: removes a curse and some other conditions.
***Fireball.*** :: attack roll. against minions, slay a number of creatures equal to the roll minus the level of the minions (one creature minimum). doesn't affect dragons.
***Lightning Bolt.*** :: attack roll. kill one minion or inflict 2 wounds to a boss.
***Sleep.*** :: instead of an Attack roll, defeat one boss of d6+L minions. doesn't affect undead, dragons and some other monsters.
***Escape.*** :: normally, or instead of a Defense roll, the wizard teleports to the first room.
***Protect.*** :: +1 to a character's Defense rolls for the battle.
### Items
***light hand weapon.*** :: walking stick.
***spell book.*** :: contains coded annotations for the known spells.
***writing tools.*** ::
}}

**Farluk** is the main spellcaster of the party. I went for a very traditional setup because the main thing for the first game(s) is to learn the mechanics, see if it is something for me, and have fun.

{{monster,frame
## Ardanmalusa
*Cleric (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 5 (4 + L)
***Wealth*** :: 2 (d6)
___
| Attack | Defense |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| +L/2 (+L) (crushing) | +1 +1   |
___
***armour*** :: Shield, light armour, heavy armour.
***weapons*** :: Hand weapon, two-handed weapon, sling.
___
***attacks.*** :: L/2 added to attack rolls. L added against undead.
***spellcasting.*** :: Cast Blessing up to 3 times. Cast Healing (d6 + L life points) up to three times. When casting from scrolls, L is only added to Blessing, otherwise, as level 1.
### Items
***light armour.*** :: leather armour.
***shield.*** :: a metal shield with an engraved sigil.
***hand weapon.*** :: a silver metal rod.
}}

not having played yet, I cannot tell, but having some healing capabilities is a good idea in general. this is a similar composition to what I used for EOB.

{{monster,frame
## Pettic
*Roque (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 4 (3 + L)
***Wealth*** :: 5 (3d6)
___
| Attack | Defense |
|:-----:|:-------:|
| (+L) -1 (slashing) | +L +1   |
___
***armour*** :: Light armour.
***weapons*** :: Light weapon, sling.
___
***defense.*** :: L added to defense.
***traps.*** :: L added to disarm traps.
***attacks.*** :: L added to attack rolls against outnumbered minions only.
### Items
***rope.*** :: can be used to tie monsters.
***lock picks.*** ::
***light armour.*** :: leather armour.
***light hand weapon.*** :: a long blade dagger.
}}

and finally my rogue (because rogues rule). the name comes from *Pyramids*, which was the book I was reading at the time (during that flight or ride, not sure what it was).

we are now almost ready to play.

## Enter the dungeon

before entering the dungeon, the party buys a lantern (paying 1 gp each), which will be carried by **Pettic**, and **Farluk** selects the spells to memorise (*Sleep*, *Fireball* and *Protect*). after this preparation they are ready to start. the friends (or at least long term companions and allies) leave the village, venturing into the forest. after a few hours walk, they reach the entry of their first ever dungeon, in search of riches and establishing a reputation. adventure awaits.

^[after reformatting this a bit at Castle, I came back home and started the adventure proper at 19:13]^

with some effort, they push open the double doors that lead to the entrance of the dungeon. ^(6)^ it is spacious but empty, with an alcove immediately to their left. at the far end of the room, two corridors are available, left and right. they choose the left one. ^(23)^ reaching an unlocked door, they hesitate for just a second, anxious about what they might find. after opening it, they encounter a wide room, apparently empty ^(9)^ and with a corridor that leads to a dead end. intrigued and disappointed, they remove take a few minutes to search a bit more thoroughly. the room is just empty ^(4)^, and they just decide to go back to the entrance to try the other path. ^(4 / 41)^ nothing seems to have changed and after opening the corresponding door, the new (and smaller) room they find has a ^(3 / 7 and 4)^ shelf with what looks like a potion (*Potion of Healing*), but it is protected with a bear trap. thankfully, the leading **Pettic** identifies it in time, stopping **Clovenia** inches away from triggering it ^(4+1: > 4)^. he disarms it and the wizzard retrieves the *Potion of Healing* to identify it. after a quick inspection, the party decides to give it to the warrior.

going through the new door on the right, they go into a small vestibule, with a second door opening into an ^(8)^ empty corridor, leading to another door. the dungeon (or at least the area closest to the entrance) seems abandoned, were it not because of the room with the trap. being suspicious, but also a bit reckless, they search this corridor. umm... that's interesting, ^(6 - 1)^ the texture is different from the rest in an area of the left wall, past the first bend. **Pettic** ^(66 / 5 / 3)^ finds the mechanism that allows the door to open, inserting his blade in the wooden panels to release a latch carefully. moving slowly, he gets his head through and all is quiet. some metal reflects the light of the lantern and for a second he pictures swords and axes in the hands of foes, and shrivels, covering the lantern. there is no sound, no movement. could it be an ambush? or are they unaware of the party?

\page
then he realises the room is actually in the dark now, and he DIDN'T ACTUALLY see anybody, just the reflections. shushing the party and letting a beam of light come out, he takes another peek. it is clearer now, just racks of weapons. phew!!! the party enters and takes a look, reconsidering their options.

**Pettic** and **Farluk Farduk** get slings and the party decides to change places for the next, with **Ardanmalusa** swapping places with the rogue. the rear guard will use their slings if some battle ensues. they have a good idea of the layout of the rooms they already went through, and the south door is probably some storage. they try that one. ^(65)^ and they are correct, or perhaps it was some hiding spot or an abandoned corridor (as it would otherwise lead to the entrance). it seems empty, and they search ^(1 / 4)^. while they are distracted looking carefully into the small space, 6 wandering hobgoblins (L4) enter the armory and attack them from behind (they might have heard noises, or seen the light of the lantern).

this first fight is happening in very bad conditions, with the party in close quarters, limited in their reactions, and outnumbered. the rogue and the wizzard, who were closer to the door, take the brunt of the attack. at least only 2 hobgoblins can attack them. **Farluk Fardukk** ^(1)^ is caught completely off guard and is wounded by the blade of one of the hobgoblins, while **Pettic** manages to dodge the attack, despite being surprised. now he reacts, drawing his blade (which was sheathed while searching) and striking down the hobgoblin that attacked him ^(6 - 1 > 4)^. the instincts and fear of the wizzard make him release a fireball, perhaps an overkill, but he is seeing 5 hobgoblins in front of him. ^(5 + 1 - 4)^ 2 hobgoblins are immediately obliterated by the roaring fire exploding in their faces, with the reflections of fire on the metal from the armory behind them, as if engulfed by orange heat. the warrior and cleric cannot do much. if only they have picked up a bow or something similar!. the three remaining hobgoblins are not deterred and advance. the wizzard is aware of the attack now, and almost ^(4)^ avoid the newer hit, but he doesn't. it is looking grim for him now. the hobgoblin facing the rogue goes too high and misses ^(5 + 1 + 1 > 4)^.

if they were fighting in some open space, like the armory, the rogue would manage jump and flank their foes, but being in a corridor makes it impossible. **Pettic** goes low and lunges forward, ^(3 -1)^ but misses. **Farluk Farduk** is worried, and just swings his walking stick, ^(1)^, striking nothing but air. **Ardanmalusa** touches her silver rod to the shield and a pulsing light goes from her to the wizzard, curing his wounds fully ^(2)^. perhaps due to this influx of vitality, he now manages to avoid a new hit from the hobgoblin in front of him ^(5)^. **Pettic** cannot say the same thing ^(2 + 1 + 1 = 4)^ and suffers a wound. *"argh! dirty hobgoblin, die!"*. the hobgoblin falls to the floor ^(5 - 1)^. seeing the tenor of the combat change, his companions start to flee. the rear (now the front) of the party look at each other and node: the hobgoblins should die here and now.

**Pettic** takes down his ^(4 + 1 - 1)^. the wizzard is not so dextrous and misses him with his stick ^(3 + 1 - 1)^. anyway, he doesn't expect to see that hobgoblin ever again, disappearing through the armory.

*"uff, that was unexpected. let's go back to the armory."*

after the fight under the lintel between the empty corridor transformed into a closet and the armory, the party goes back to the armory and take a breather. ^[I am not checking for wandering monsters because I played the previous battle as happening at the edge of both rooms.]^

the rearguard folks switch to their slings. going through the other door of the armory, towards the north, the party reach an empty intersection of corridors, going in all directions. they go east, thinking about connecting it with the path they came from. the door they open ^(23)^ leads to a room at the end of a corridor. there they face 7 armed goblins (L3). time for another fight, this time in more favourable conditions. two slings spin in the air, launching two bullets. ^(5 - 1 / 3 - 1)^ one of them hits and knocks down a foe. the party spreads and both the skirmishers take their time to switch to close combat weapons. but **Clovenia** is already rushing the goblins, followed by the party cleric. a flurry of blows ^(5 + 1)^ takes down two enemies. **Ardanmalusa** is not successful ^(2 + 1/2 = 2)^. in the one against one fight that ensues, ^(4)^ the wizzard is untouched, the same as the rogue ^(3 + 1 + 1)^. the heavy hitters deflect the attacks against them with their shield ^(4 + 1 + 1)^ and broadsword ^(2 + 1 + 1)^. unfazed, they retaliate. the cleric seems to be too slow, or perhaps her rod is too short. whichever the cause, her strike goes wide ^(2 + 1/2)^. the warrior compensates by taking down one more foe ^(2 + 1)^. with this, the goblins start to flee ^(3)^. the rogue fails to chase them ^(1)^, but **Farluk Farduk** ^(5 - 1)^ stick hits the back of the head of one of them. this battle ended swiftly, with only 2 goblins escaping, and leaving some treasure. the party finds a gem ^(5 - 1)^ worth ^((2 + 1) * 5)^ 15 gp. not bad, but also not as glorious as they would have expected after an hour and a half of exploring. they open another door leading to a small cubicle ^(41)^ ^[cropped due to being very close to the edge]^, surprisingly full of ^(5 + 1)^ some kind of vermin, ^(5)^ 2 vampire frogs (L4)?

^(1 + 1/2)^ the cleric hits air, but the warrior ^(4 + 1)^ takes down one with a direct stroke to the bulk of the body. a bullet flies from behind ^(6 + 3 - 1)^, from **Pettic**'s sling, smashing the last vampire frog. ^(1 - 1)^ no treasure is found, and the party takes some time to search, swapping position, so that the more armoured members keep guard. this time is also empty, but there is no patrol nor surprises either. the party decides to go back to search the previous room, on their way to the intersection of corridors.

\page
upon closer inspection, a clue is found ^(5)^ by **Clovenia**, in the form of some parchment with strange markings, and a purple wax seal. *"I'll keep this. it might be meaningful moving forward."*

going back to the intersection, ^(1 / 4 / 6)^ a group of 8 fungi folk (L3) erupt from a side corridor, surprising the party! 

^[23:00. this adventure is taking a long time, probably because I am also writing this chronicle. time for a break.]^
