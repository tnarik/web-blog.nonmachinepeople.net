# outro/intro

after the last patrol in Langston, I said my goodbyes to continue my trip to the Ephenbald's farm. got rid of some clutter before the trip and reflected a bit on the experience and conversations with Roy during my trip into the forest and towards the coast.

I feel more robust, having had a first round of real battles, and practiced archery quiet a lot, a much preferred approach than using swords to fight. from spending some time and chats with Roy I realised I can manipulate the magic essence present in nature and perform some spells. part of it applies to my archery, and now I am able able to mark my quarries if I concentrate, allowing me to hit more precisely, causing more damage. this is great! I feel like a suddenly much better archer!

also, food. I learned to create goodberries, kind of magic snack food but packed with nutrients. say bye to rations! it feels weird eating so little and feeling satiated and requiring only water, but it would do in a pinch, and it is great not having to worry about food. but I would miss a lot eating and chewing, so let's consider it a bit of... emergency rations.

and that's all, I kept travelling.

some of it was lonely. paths in the forest, or not well frequented roads. some of it got me onto busier roads and I accompanied a small caravan for a while. upon making night with the caravan near a trade post, I wandered around and found myself sitting near a bonfire and sharing some wine (finally!) with some explorers. we talked for a long time and they shared their stories and current tasks: they talked about exploring a jungle where rumours say there is an ancient lost city. that expedition is following the steps of a previous expedition that failed, and they need some support: a guide, or perhaps a map.
after waking up the next day, with a bit of a hangover, the caravan and the explorers where already gone, but apparently the explorers left too fast: a rider came and enquired about them. it seems there was a map they could use, or they were contacted to deliver. either there was some confusion, they decided not to retrieve it or were not aware of. perhaps this rider was another explorer that was late to the party and changed their mind. however it was, I agreed to deliver the map to the expedition into/through the jungle in exchange of an equal share of the treasure (the rider produced some contract, either theirs or a blank one) and a payment advance.
money is not that relevant (even if it helps, of course), but the opportunity to explore the jungle and the remains of some ancient civilisation were enticing. did they coexist with nature? what are their stories?

so he accepted, took the 75gp advance, the map, the contract and spend the day getting to the jungle. it seemed a fantastic place to get lost and dehydrated due to the heat, and somewhat dangerous due to the (mostly unknown to Blovo) fauna and flora, which he could feel from its outer bounds. but he decided to continue, spend the night in an improvised camp at the boundaries and then march into the jungle at dawn, making a good pace with the goal of joining the explorers before the end of the day. he is tough and very capable to survive alone in nature, but this is new terrain for him.

left the scrapling claw at Langston, for the guard to use if needed.

p0: so that’s where we are… not far from the expedition camp. yes, they had wagons. ummm, that was a very loud trill, I didn’t hear this one before. let’s see what is going on. 

p74 some lizardfolk are surrounding the expedition (an expedition?). a human is seemly the leader and they claim to have permission, but maybe the lizardfolk changed their mind. there is also some orcish sage/scholar. there is some exchange of words and hissing, the mention of Z’leth upsets the lizardfolk, or rattles them. there is plenty of tension between the two groups and this could explode. time to do or say something.

p12 I am new to this discussion/situation, but I think I should talk to the lizardfolk first, as this is their part of the world, and it is clear to me who the leader is (I might be wrong). I clear my throat. “I am Ylbifin Ephenbald, a member of this expedition… I was away when this started, what is the problem, if I may ask?”

rolled 16

p62 made a good argument for deescalation of the situation, to avoid harm to both sides. it lloks like I convinced them, and the expedition leader (the woman) plays along calling me diplomat. and mentioning the map I carry.
