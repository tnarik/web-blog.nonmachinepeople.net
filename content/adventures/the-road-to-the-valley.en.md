# Langston

This is my attempt to chronicle the adventures of Blovo during his brief time in Langston (**"The wolves of Langston"**), based on some notes taken at that time. this chronicle contains a combination of short notes with names, impressions and actions, as well as portions of a bit more elaborate retelling which I, as chronicler, put together trying to compose some sort of narrative.

in time, everything might be rearranged in this last format, but for now some parts would appear as written by Blovo (his thoughts or what he said), while some might be written by me, the chronicler.

interpersed in the text, there would be notes about decision points (denoted by ^p^), the outcome of chance checks (denoted by ^(roll)^) and some editor/chronicler notes (denoted by ^[note]^)

## chapter 1

the day is nearing its end and Blovo is on the road. he is approaching the city of Langston, the night closing in, when he hears some howling in the distance, getting closer. ^p0 - p23 - p40^ wolves appear in the forest and Blovo runs to get to the gates of Langston, sprinting along the road while chased by wolves.
::
^[it all started 2023-09-30]^

a dwarf (dressed like Blovo imagines a druid would do). he shoos them away. ^p4^ he is called Roy Sunderhammer and suggests getting to the inn. ^p1^ Blovo goes into Langston, which seems to be empty. or at least its marketplace and streets are. he can only see someone who seems to be a sun cleric. he decides to call them out. ^p27^ it is indeed a young sun cleric, getting ready for the last rites of a young woman. instead of following in, Blovo first looks through the window. ^p19^ a packed room, and a barmaid invites Blovo in. the name of the deceased is Maybelline, her funeral is indeed held at The Pickled Hen and the Mayor of the town is interested in talking to travellers or adventurers (which is what Blovo is). ^p34^

*a drunk confronts me, and a half-orc with a stylish suit is watching (I imagine it is the major).* Blovo tries to intimidate the drunk ^p20^ *I don't mind finishing fights*, but Blovo doesn't seem threatening enough and ^p36^ Tanya (also known as Mayor Anathram), the female half-orc, stops the drunk from starting the fight. he leaves. ^p44 - p28^ the funeral begins (and the Mayor wants to talk once it finishes). 

the parents are the first to talk. then, the fiancé (Tomlin) speaks. ^p32^ it looks like his nickname is "The Wolf". that, on its own, is suspicious to Blovo. *there is something wrong about all of this, maybe HE is a newcomer in the village. or just a womaniser, perhaps?* something is very odd here. Blovo tries to use his insight (this is not the place nor moment to investigate, specially with him being a new face himself). ^p46 - p29^ *yes, I have a feeling that Tomlin is some kind of Don Juan and everyone in town knows that, or at least all women do. it looks like Roy is about to talk now.* ^p13^
Roy is the druid assigned to Langston. something weird happened with his beard when he sneezed, while creating flowers via a spell. Blovo tries to focus on the changes that took place. ^p14 - p42^
*if it were not impossible, I would say the druid was becoming a wolf? he might be a werewolf, or why would his appearance change like this for a second? it is also very strange that Tomlin’s nickname is The Wolf.* the Sun cleric is going to talk now. ^p39^

her name is Solaine. she looks like she changed as well, at least in the character. she looks more confident. ^p43 - p45^ *did she have an affair with Tomlin? Maybe that makes her stronger and more confident?* ^p25^
Tanya is talking now. she has a giant mastiff. she used to be a soldier. *she is it going to talk to me now. and she comes with the dog*. ^p6^ Blovo focuses on the dog, just in case it is a danger. ^p22^ it is definitely a military dog ^p30^ after some talk, the Mayor hires Blovo as an investigator. the town pays for a room at the inn and so he will retire for the night.

time for a long rest ^p26^
::
^[after roughly an hour playing. a bit less, as it is 2023-09-30 11:39 now]^

*I woke up refreshed. after I got my breakfast, headed towards the town hall and I am now in front of the Mayor, who is with her dog. as much as I care for animals, this dog is a military dog and I recognise that a battle dog is not the kind of dog eager to be petted.* Blovo greets the mayor. ^p21^

she says the girl looked like she was attacked by a beast, but she was found within town, not on the outskirts or the woods. and Roi is meant to take care of keeping the woods in check (free from monsters or hazards). *she is offering 320gp to take care of the threat. I don't need the money, and I'm on my way to my family, but that poor girl... it doesn't seem natural. it is not as if she was mauled by wolves out of carelessness. something needs to be done.* ^p48^
Tomlin was an herbalist, as it seemed (he talked about flowers before). he lives in the western part of town. *thanks to the Mayor, I get access to the general store now. I'm not going right now, but whenever I'm in town I can, nice*
Blovo got an advance of 20 gp, and now he is heading to Tomlin's. ^p49^

::
^[from this point, it will be told from Blovo's point of view, as he took lots of notes]^

\page
## chapter 2

I see the drunk from last night again, people seems embarrased. good. his attidude doesn't seem to be a common feeling in the town. good ^p84^
I get to Tomlin's cottage and decide to take a look around. He might not be a suspect (not to the villagers), but there is something fishy about the guy. plus he might not be in. ^p77^
yep, he was hooking up with another woman already. not judgement (I don't know him), but it doesn't match his speech from last night. and he is acting ashamed, so he thinks he needs to pretend and knows it looks bad. none of my business, no moral judgement here. ^p95^
silence. we say nothing, he invites me in. I get in to the cottage. ^p69^
he offers some tea, I do not drink tea (I don't like tea), but want to check it out. ^p54^
let's use what I know about nature. ^p97^ ^(used one inspiration but got a 11)^

no clue. ^p50^ let's refuse the tea (it might be poisoned or not, who knows, but I don't like tea). ^p86^

he doesn't have a problem with it, just drinks his. ^p80^ he tells me a sudden love found story, somehow rushed, but it fits. has he seen anything strange? ^p62^
the wolves have been more active (or at least loud) in the last couple of months. there are also some strangers camped near Emmitt and Tilly's farm. it looks like Roi also sleeps outside, it seems (which make sense for a druid). there are also complains about thefts from villagers.

I also ask where he was the night of the death. ^p101^ he kind of gets angry, but quickly seems ashamed and reveals he was with friends, at the tarvern. a bit of a crazy night. let me investigate and ask a few more questions about that night ^p83^ something is missing... wait, where was Maybelline? ^p104^

he recalls it was a full moon and she didn't go out, because she was superstitious. Tomlin was meeting a childhood friend with some marital issues. was it really just him and friends in the tavern? ^p74^
ah, Solaine was also there. Tomlin and her were lovers before her pilgrimage. but, while she was away, Maybelline and him fell in love.
Solaine was not happy (to be expected), but Tomlin thinks she came around. in fact, she would have performed the wedding (it was either her or Roi). Roi was also there, and he left when he started sneezing and coughing. the kind of fit that he had during the funeral...

did Maybelline have any enemies (that he knows)? ^p56^ Tomlin says no, but... let me dig deeper. let's persuade him ^[this time using the d20, not the d12 as when testing the tea... :/]^ ^(because this is important, used inspiration)^ ^p85^ not enemies, he confesses, but there were conflicts.
she argued with Mayor Anathram, and Maybelline never argued that he knows. really out of character.

also, well, Solaine shut herself in the tower for a while, clearly hurt. there were no discussions that he knows. and he didn't speak to Solaine much then.
ok, let's wrap this convo. ^p62 - p105^

just before leaving he mentions some damage on the garden at night, clawed prints in the soil. I'll check the garden. ^p78^
umm... let's check the trellis of the plot ^p81^
some plants are pretty damaged. the plot is well taken care of. well trodden. I'm looking closer ^(used inspiration but it was not needed)^ ^p75^
are two attacking us? I wasn't expecting that. ^p64^

these are two scraplings. small humanoid, seemly made out of dry wook. I engage in fight to death with one of them (Tomlin is taking care of the other one).

the scrapling is faster, he attacks ^(12 is less than my armour class (AC))^. it misses me with its claws.
I draw one of my short swords and take a swing at the creature ^(14, equal to AC)^. I manage to hit and ^(6+3) kill the thing.
::
^[Blovo played in his head/dice if he could kill the second, even though Tomlin is engaging with it. Even **more** "imaginarily" he would have drawn the second short sword, there would have been a round of missing hits for both, and on the third overall round, with initiative, he would have struck it down. BUT does is imagination, in reality Tomlin was taking care of it.]^

after dealing the final blow ^p88^, I seath the swords and take as a souvenir the scrapling claw that Tomlin offers to me. that was a plant creature, maybe Roi nows about them. Evening is approaching. I'm about to leave for the inn, but Tomlin wants me to follow him inside again. ^p72^
he gives mea vial containing philter of remembrance (10 doses). ^p106^ I make my way back to the inn. 
I get a meal, and get ready for a long (and well deserved) rest. ^p93^

I wake up with moonlight. it got interrupted (just a short reset). there is some hairy and hunched shape on a neighbouring roof. it is extending an arm in my direction, as if waiting.
I call out to the creature, might be Roi in some weird beast shape. ^p79^

golden yellow glints on the eyes, the createure snarls *"He's mine!"* WTF? it disappears. I go out to investigate, and will get my short sword in my hand as soon as I am out. ^p87^ can I climb the wall? I seath my sword. ^(failed roll)^ ^p59^
no way I can climb that, better go back and stay to keep watch. ^p55^
not much rest (another short rest), and at some point it starts to rain. that would probably erase all traces. there is some noise outside my door. ^p107^

a cold breakfast, and empty common room, and quiet streets. the wagon with flowers from the funeral is still outside. I should now go to talk to the druid. ^p108^

::
^[chapter 2 represents about one hour of play]^

\page
## chapter 3
this is a very quiet wood. beautiful and peaceful, but eerily quiet. ^p122^
I stopped in a clearing to drink some water and now looked around ^(7 + 4 x 2 due to the forest being Blovo's favoured terrain,... but it should have been 7 + 4 + 2 because only the proficiency bonus was doubled. I will let it pass this time)^ - ^p155^
there is a beast there. a stirge, of course. let's fight a bit! 
1st, I quickly take my bow and attack right before it turns to see me. ^p144^
my first arrow hits, doing 8 damage and finishing the haggard stirge while it was turning towards me. ^p138^
I take a brief rest and the woods stay as quiet as before. nothing changed. I keep going to the druid's. ^p150^
I get there, to what looks like a cottage with almost no walls. just some simple furniture around. hold on, there is some kind of wolf in the grove. I bet this is the druid. I just walk into the grove. ^p156^
the wolf gets into view, defensive, but not aggresive, I think. something red on it's muzzle. looks like blood. I approach it peacefully. ^p110^
it looks confused (I think he was trying to intimidate me a bit), I just talk to it normally, IN DWARVISH because I'm pretty sure it is Roi and I'm a dwarf. ^p134^
yes, it can understand me. but it doesn't transform, he goes into the cabin and comes back with a wooden druid symbol. yep, this is the druid indeed. ^p158^
"why don't you revert back? let's talk, Roi." he shakes his head. motions me to follow (I can tell by the way he moves and waits). inside everything is quite sloppy and disarrayed. he pints with his snout to some scrolls. I go throuht them and he puts his paw on one, "Doppleganger's Curse" aka Polypiox. ah, not a werewolf then, but some disease which means he cannot control his changes. he might even get amnesia.
there is a recipe for a cure (with wolfsbane, sage and hornwort). I can get the herbs from Tomlin or from around. "are you sure it is polypox?" ^p113^
yep, he is.
let me search around. ^p146^
looking for sage. ^p125^
no need to the double proficiency from the terrain. ^p109^
succeess. now for some hornwort ^p120^
there is a shallow pond. I search with help from Roi. ^p131^
success! now wolfsbane. ^p133^
Roi helped again (and I have lived in the woods for days at a time) ^p154^
so I collect some, carefully to avoid toxins. Roi darts to the grove. ^p140^
I brew some tea out of the ingredients, pour it into a bowl. Roi laps his medicine. he lies down,, and I wait with him, comfortable on the ground. apparently passed via the stirge by somebody or something else. he gives me the Silverstar, a gift from Solaine's predecessor, a cleric.

Roi needs to rest, but I'll ask a couple of questions. first the scrapling claw. ^p163^
not the killer (I didn't think so). but he transforms it into a +1 club for a week.
"before I leave, just a quick question: when did you get sick?" ^p135^
sniffling aoround new moon, he says, sneezing and chaging a couple of weeks later, he says. and Maybelline died on a full moon. hummm
he doesn't think he suffers amnesia. he wasn't sneezing during the full moon, aparently. today was the first change. he laughs the hint of a suspicion off.

polypox is bloodborne, he is pretty sure it was the stirge (me too, he seems sincere), not from a werewolf, but werewolves can get polypox, or just be carriers.

"Well, Roi, thanks. take care", ^p124^
I get back and eat, have some bad dreams about being attacked by rosebushes or running around in all fours. Also dreamt with the shape from last night. wake up startled. I don't see anything outside the window. but... I'll try to keep watch, forgot about that shape. ^p160^
nothing happened, just that rest was short.

sun rises and there is a knock at the door. ^p128^
the innkeeper brought a hot breakfast. Solaine has been asking for me last night and this morning. will I visit her? she asked for me to go to the temple. she thinks she can help.

oh, is this a note from the mayor? "thanks". I eat and read. ^p164^

there is a new lead. I'm commanded to go to the town hall.
I'm not sure I like being commanded, and I'm spending too long here instead of looking into my origins while going back to the Ephenbald farm, but... ah, hell, I also wanted more experiences. ^p165^

(1h more or less)

\page
## chapter 4

almost a normal day, but not really, ^p193^
the mayor says I should go and check the strangers living outside town (I think she refers to those). they make people uncomfortable, it seems. um... ^p212^
I think they might not be related to the murder, but might know something, and being outsiders might be more impartial. I'm not going to ask for more money. ^p232^
bandits, she calls them now. don't think that's what they are either. ok, let's check it out. back to the forest trails. ^p176^
a normal forest this time, it seems calm and peaceful. ^p215^
a clearing with a dryad and a robin. I heard about this creature, didn't meet any yet. I'm not going to attack. I should sneak, that's none of my business right now. (p168 is an errata, it should be ^p203^).
I try to go without disturbing her, stealthy. oh, I fail. (but ^p198^ is an errata, as it is for a SUCCESSFUL roll. so... ^p230^ it is).
I step on a dry twig and then a pile of dried leaves. clearly not the day to be quiet. she reacts like about to attack,, but hesitates, a spell at the ready. ok, let's talk. ^p200^
she peaks broken Common. do I know Sylvan? I think I don't. arg. ^p177^
it would have to do. "strings grab friends" nets? lassos? I will try to help. I'm a ranger anyway, protecting nature is my thing. gives me a potion of barkskin (a toughener of sorts). it seems the camp is empty for now (the strangers/bandits are gone for a while). ask for directions. ^p195^
she guides me, graceful and quiet, to an entrance point into another clearing. a firepit with trash from meals, charred bones and old porridge. not a lush clearing. this are hunters, or poachers. ^p182^
no kindling around for tonight, it seems. something is kept outside of animals reach, hanging from a tree. but other than that is like a trashy bivouac place. I investigate thoroughly, inspired by the forest. due to the advantage, I rolled twice and got a natural crit the second roll. ^p207^
what I see:
- a warrant made out to Horace and Titch of 100s of gp (information) or 1000s (capture dead or alive) for the Wolf of the Road, which has an Orcish name (pretty obvious it is Orciash). They killed a constable in Three Rivers. I take this with me. I guess the bandits/strangers are these "Horace" and "Titch" individuals. gear is tattered and in disrepair.
- on a second oilcloth: an agate brooch (15gp) and a flimsy jeweled dagger (5gp). ^p183^

night is coming. days are short here, damn! I get to town with the sun set, stairs starting to shine. (a letter from/to Emmitt is mentioned, but I don't have any and a quick search doesn't seem to mention any either. um... my version might be OLD/WRONG... I think it refers to the warrant?).
the mayor received some sealed message, she is NOT at the town hall. I get the address to her house. cool. ^p206^
two figures (Horace and Titch, I guess) are waiting when the mayor comes. do I read some tension? they greet each other not very friendly. but go into the house together, with Horace first, and Titch last. Light illuminates the window, the door is shut. I get closer. ^p197^
small and neglected garden, stones and timber. angrily raised voices come from inside.
I keep listening. ^p188^
they are shouting, the guard dog barks. ^p229^
they are angry, but I cannot tell anything else. I'll knock. ^p205^
conversation goes silent. the mayor inquires who is there. who? me, is everything ok? further silence, the mayor opens the door. she seems courteous now. wtf?
I step in. the lean bandit has a dagger at her back? oh, my. the Mayor seems to ignore all the guy. what is going on?
am I a hostage? the mayor gestures me to comply. ok, but... ^p209^
not a hosting situation, but they are menacing somehow. mayor and dog are furious but restrain themselves. hinting at... the Mayor or one of them knowing more about the killing due to a revealed secret? oh, shit. ^p192^
so, the Mayor is the Wolf of the Road, these guys (yes, Horace and Titch) say. they have a poster linked to the warrant I have. I say what I know: no sense threatening with reinforcements or their party (there is none), no additional proof. their gambit didn't work, the mayor is going to retaliate, I guess. I threaten them. just want them to go away and sort this out with the mayor. ^p199^
*oh, I cannot intimidate them. so ^p228^ it is fighting time.* ^p178^
I take TItch, while the Mayor and Buttercup engage Horace.
Titch tries to swing at me with a dagger. and hits, a bit more than a glance, 4 HP.
I draw my shortsword and hit for 8HP, nice. this will end soon.
Titch hits again, ^(4 HP)^.
but now I have my two shortswords out. He dodges my first strike, but the second one hits fully, ^(6HP)^.
My part is done. ^p184^
I don't kill Titch, the Mayor stops the fight. Horace surrenders, having thrown his knife. the Mayor has the weapon at the ready, doesn't want more fight. It might be that she was this killer, but her ways changed. I choose to believe this. and I choose to let the bandit live, the poor bastard. ^p231^
did the stupid Horace treathen me AFTER I let his friend live? stupid guy. they leave. ^p191^
I give what I found to the Mayor. I would expect an explanation. she says she did not kill the constable. he was alive when she escaped with Buttercup.
so, she was the leader of a band of bandits, a bandit crew. and Wolf of the Road was her name, and they operated around Three Rivers. crime after not fitting within orc nor human societies, after being a warrior.
H and T broke into the home of a resistance leader, to threaten him about making life easier for the bandits, but overdid it and beat him to death.

the Mayor didn't want to feel responsible for further deaths, and left, escaped. all this by making the bandits raid an invading force, with her disappearing in the chaos. the town assumed she was a veteran and she didn't correct them. just lied. Maybelline had found out, from H or T making noise. the Mayor thinks there was redemption or that at least she was not a murderer. that's not what Maybelline thought. ^p221^
that's what they argued about, I think. and she is really sad and wishing for a resolution. she is also grateful. I ask for something to protect myself. ^p172^
she gives me an amulet she was wearing around her neck, a lesser amulet of the beast. ^p222^
what doesn't burn now should really burn. ^p211^
her secret is safe. Buttercup is licking my palm. I'll earn this dog trust. back to the inn, I need some rest. ^p202^
completely empty streets, a single long and low howl. already cold dinner, going to bed with a faint howl in the distance. ^p236^

(1h30')
this will be a long rest, more on that later.

(7 hours later, at 5:30 AM) but before going to bed I study the amulet and the silverbane, reflecting on both the fight from tonight and the druid sickness. I attuned. and then go to bed, having a good and relaxing night and recovering fully. breakfast is ready as well as a note of gratitude from the mayor. The funeral will be tomorrow, so I better go to the temple to inspect the body. and talk to Solaine, which is well overdue. ^p237^

\page
## chapter 5

the sun temple is old, a limestone building seemingly predating the town. I got in, but there is nobody around. I’ll explore. ^p296^

from the central hall I head towards the dining hall. they might be having breakfast. ^p267^

let’s explore the dining room further. ^p277^

nothing. the kitchen perhaps? ^p280^

a single setting of cutlery’s and plates. is Solaine the only one here? the kitchen is windowless, the dining room had 5 tables with 8 seats each. the stove is not used very much (rusty), but there is ash around the door. umm ^p244^
there us some fabric or clothing charred remains. let’s see. ^p269^

^p255^
these are burned holy vestments. not in good condition before burning. seams burst, one cuff has blood? droplets. it crumbles

what is there in the larder? ^p310^

forgotten food: veggies, potatoes, bread. moldy and wilted. but fresh meat, plenty of it. with… small bite marks? I “smell” werewolf. back to the front hall. ^p296^

up north towards the library. ^p258^

pretty large, books and scrolls on one table. nobody. religious texts and some history tomes. something about treaty common curses. also a black book with a title not in Common, bound with skin other than a leather. and a metal lock open. 
let’s check the book on curses. ^p281^
“Compendium of Curses 17th Edition”, with descriptions of curses, diagrams of wards and sections with cures. what was the cleric reading about? ^p288^
on a page with Lwelyn’s face and lycanthropy there is a sheet with a note. elegant calligraphy but some words are crossed out and there are small marks of… tears? A letter to Tomlin, I believe. “a truly changed woman’, mentions to a darkness blooming, and it is unfinished. Leave the letter where it is. ^p279^
what about the black book? ^p314^
sharkskin? brimstone smell and oily touch. I don’t think I can understand this book. ^p249^
black sun, weapons, sharp tools, study of corpses or bones. a note (“This one”) on an entry with images of animated corpses?. I go back, ^p296^

living quarters, ^p245^

30 room, 6 on each side + 1. only the one on the far end is closed. skylighted hall,, morning sunshine. dusty. let’s check the area (I’m investigating, of course). ^p240^
p287
do not really see anything. I knock. ^p253^
nothing. open and walk in. ^p302^
not empty, sparse. check before and table. ^p311^
neat, do not think it was used recently. there is also an envelope, opened many times already. I will check this. ^p242^
A love letter: A Thyme for Love in the Sun, by Tomlin,, to Solaine. very bad poem. returned and look at the wardrobe. ^p275^
religious vestments, one very repaired, very recently. some gap between it and the wall. let’s see, ^p299^
even though I’m weak in general, it looks like I’m strong enough to push the closet aside. perhaps because of the very good rest from last night. ^p238^
I retrieve a ribbon. ^p247^
a lavender strip of silk. bloodstained. lavender was a favourite of Maybelline.

I go back to the hall. ^p296^ and wait for Solaine. ^p270^
but waiting is so dumb. let’s better check the... golden floor mosaic. ^p243^
um... there are no tiles. it looks like a single stone (or magic). there is some indentation on the central holy symbol. gnome hand size, the shape of a smaller sunburst. umm. ^p241^
I investigate. ^p283^
no clue. let’s press on it. ^p303^
ups, some magic build up. I manage to dodge the light, but it feels like it could have hurt a bit. the seam disappears, it looks like something got back into place, the opening is hidden now. oh, my. let’s see the tapestries. ^p290^

they depict the holy order raising the temple and banishing the undead. darkness and the undead devouring people, holy figures appearing, a ring formation and light striking, a ring of green plants and blue skies. with a band of black earth and floating dark red eyes. waiting. does it remind me of anything? ^p309^

^p257^
this is an ancient order of sun worshippers. 100s or 1000s of years ago. while the order has a presence (even one) and dedication to the light, the area is protected. do not remember more. I’ll just have to wait longer. ^p294^

she finally returns to the temple. hem of the robe soiled black, some soil clumps falling from her slippers. I startled her.p268
she is alone here perhaps overwhelmed but acting as if it is ok. big smiles. 
what about the undead? ^p248^
Tomlin? ^p315^
is common knowledge. she doesn’t hide the story.
ok, let’s check the body. ^p289^
she says I cannot. why? ^p295^
^p254^

see seems afraid. not sure what from. she says it is out of concern about the family, not fear. ok. but I can check. ^p293^
I go alone, to the cemetery,, entering from the north. a bright day. the mausoleum is in the center of the graveyard. uh-oh, a grave with some black earth, but not dug up? undead? let’s check, do not want to risk a surprise while investigating. ^p264^
dug from underneath. a person dead for decades. a crack in its skull and a broken piece of paving half-buried in the dark soil (the unusually dark soil). seems thrown there.

check Maybelline, what a morning. ^p276^
oh, Maybelline is reanimated. will have to fight her. ^p286^
I’m faster, move back within the mausoleum and take my bow, readying an arrow. 9 HP. I move further to put distance between us, making her come out, I think I’m faster. it approaches and remains 5 feet away. 
I now do the same thing again, putting distance in between and sending an arrow her way. see is pretty weak now, it seems. comes near me, still not within reach. I drop the bow and get a sword out, ready for the next attack. but there is a burst of movement and she gets next to me, slamming me. ups, that hurt! I swing my sword, 2HP to go. 
take my second sword out, attack. and done. ^p297^
for a second it looks like that last blow might not really do it, but after some last death rattle (undeath rattle?) she drops dead. again? ^p246^
look at that. ^p262^
I recover my bow and one arrow. the other one broke.
the previous wounds seem inflicted by a wild animal. broad and deep claw marks. not very forest beast like. a rage driven attack based on the patterns and random look. I look at the bouquet of pink flowers she dropped. ^p307^
the only flowers I see around, with a tag signed by Tomlin. daisies in the mix. ^p250^
ah, Solaine is still there. I think she has doubts about her faith, and she is not paying attention to me. I need to interrupt her, ^p306^
yep, I’ll tell the mayor. to me, Solaine is not a member of the order any more. or not a dedicated one. but… well, I leave. she goes back to the library. ^p252^

I’ll go on patrol, I can take a rest before that, recovering from the fight. and ready to go. ^p301^
no zombies or ghouls. but two body remains, torn apart it seems. same kind of wounds as Maybelline had. I come back in the wee hours, and fall asleep. 
no food at the door, but the mayor is having breakfast waiting for me. in the common area. ^p317^

## chapter 6

I should be ready for an accusation. although I’m not entirely sure I may need more information. I think it’s Solaine but I don’t have an unequivocal proof. ^p334^
I get to the town square and everything seems ready. a Document is being read by the mayor’s aide. Lots of common folk around, and also the main people I talked to these days.

It’s a bit of a tough decision, and I hate accusing anyone without a full proof. But I think Solaine is affected by lycanthropy. and so she killed without being hundred percent conscious. Therefore j’accuse. ^p341^
I will use the silk ribbon as proof. ^p355^
this is a bit of a gambit/bait because Maybelline was wearing the pink ribbon, and it is a bit circumstantial (could have gotten there in a different way).
Tomlin is upset and tries to attack her. he is stopped. she looks at Tomlin. I would say she is angry at the betrayal. love, I think, not a plan gone awry. I have no more proof. I rest my case. ^p340^
two militia men approach her. she sounds defiant. All kindness gone. she sounds aggressive, like going mad ^p320^
yep, she just transformed into a werewolf. well, she is a werewolf and transformed into the beasty version. she takes down there to militia men that were flanking her, and charges towards Tomlin. ^p329^
people stampedes. because of people fleeing, I cannot jump into action, she takes Tomlin through the crowd with one long claw, climbs the wall of a building, howls, and runs towards the temple. Roy thinks it’s a curse that can be cured. Probably who is the medallion, the silverstar. I run to the temple. ^p360^
I unseath and run as fast as I can. a scream. Tomlin is in a pool of blood. I got too late. Solaine definitely left a trail, going into the temple. not panicking (and thinking she cannot leave without me knowing), I examine the murder scene. (p322 is an errata… let me see… ^p342^).
I check for clues about the threat she poses. I’m inspired by the last days of getting to know the town and this people. ^p347^
these were angry blows, and precise with the intent to kill. But see maybe remorseful. I go in, both swords at the ready. ^p324^
when I get in, everything seems darker, more menacing. there is a spiral staircase in the main hall. darkness instead of the sunburst mosaic. but the same kind of orbs for light as above. it looks like part of the original design. I advance carefully through the corridors. ^p363^
Solaine is in werewolf form in the middle of a large chamber. whining. I think she regrets her action. (she stares at the blood on her claws) or perhaps being cursed, or failing the order vows.
she sees me, doesn’t move.
“you shouldn’t be here”, she says. I think we can talk. better curing a curse than fighting. It is worth trying. I sheath one sword and keep the other one low. ^p328^

at least I'll buy some time, or solve some unanswered questions. why did she kill Tomlin? (play the guilt card). ^p352^
she felt used and betrayed. quite logic. I don't think it is wort asking about Maybelline. but, what about the curse? ^p346^

she was attacked by a wolf during her pilgrimage, more or less as I imagined. nobody thought about a curse, she just appeared ill, with a fever. woke up covered in blood after a full moon night, got scared and fled. she feels really powerful now. and the sacred power is... gone? she clearly thinks so. she is going pretty angry now. ah, damn it, one more question about Maybelline, just to confirm the story I assumed most probable. ^p339^
Solaine says Maybelline was lying about herself, that she was very cruel. that she mocked her for her faith. could Maybelline be in kahoots with a demon? or related to this darkness below Langston? anyway, I need to end this and go back to my trip home. let's try to end this peacefully by removing the curse. ^p343^
I offer the possibility of a surrender. she laughs and says she expects nothing from the town other than be hanged. just a predator now. my sword is ready. ^p350^
werewolves are immune to ordinary weapons, I heard. um... 
I'll try to stun her with the potion and then use the silverstar. ^p353^
I didn't use any dose, so it should be easy to impact, also due to werewolves relying a lot on smell. 13 (second DC throw +1, and the lowest of the two) < 18. ^p325^
she should be stunned 2 rounds, apparently lost in memories of Tomlin, both happy and sad. now I'm in a good place for a fight. ^p350^
time to try the silverstar. ^p364^
there is no fight yet (which is what I feared). I don't need to jump through a wall of fangs and claws, but I leap forward anyway, making contact between Solaine and the Silverstar. magic comes out into her form. we are lock in place, and a bunch of people pours into the chamber: Mayor Anatharm, Roi and armed townspeople. I press harder, praying it works, Solaine still stunned. ^p358^
Solaine jerks and howls. lighs sparkle. no longer stunned, she transforms into human, and the howl into a scream. she feels robbed, and collapses sobbing. the militia carries her off. ^p338^
her eyes dart to mine with fire, and a sudden smile. I feel a chilling sensation.
the Mayor, Roi and I leave to the surface, everybody grateful. ^p332^
everybody is eager to get back to normality, washing the blood, sharing the news, talking brightly on a clear day (once again). they might not think too much about the undead. will they resurrect imediately? soon? in a few weeks?
I accused Solaine, I think I did very well in my investigation. ^p369^
I get a decent reward (350gp) and feel I learnt quite a lot (600xp). I put the money on my backpack. and I get ready to talk to the Mayor. to me, there is some unfinished business and I would love to get it sorted out before going back to the inn for a rest and departing. I might even reflect on what I learnt, before going to bed. ah, there is no mention to the advance I was given, so I'm keeping those 20gp as well.

(that was a 1AM to 2AM last journey before some quick reading and sleeping for tomorrow IRL)

# epilogue

I decided to stay at least 2 more days, to reflect on what happened and trace a plan forward. the town hall is paying for a couple more days if I go on patrol, as I explained to the Mayor what transpired from the conversation with Solaine and information at the temple.

I feel more knowledgeable and sturdy. (I level up) I can recover better. practiced my archery to depend less on swords or closer fighting. I got quite good a tracking, and I try to pull focus on a given creature for tracking while on patrol. is this magic? did I gain some affinity with magic, and is that the way it works? I go on patrol and eat.

I talked to the druid about this, is that how it was for him? I heard of rangers with some magical or uncanny skills, but always assumed people meant just very good at tracking, or interacting with animals, things like that. he explained how to find magic in nature, and how to try and weave it, or modify the tapestry of it a bit to bend things in your favour. also, he taught me how to create Goodberries. not as difficult as I thought, somewhat tasty. still strange how they appear in your hand.

to the epilogue! ^p370^

I’ve been on patrol several nights, looking for undead and facing them while The Radiant Order is reached. is tiring but this is good and worried people. all pull together to help the town while a new cleric comes.

I should go and check for healing potions at Tomlin’s Cottage. ^p380^
 
it is urgent, Roi cannot heal anymore for today and it is needed, there is an injured militia member on a tavern table. the cottage is locked and I need to break in somehow. breaking a window should be simple.. ^p377^
clink: very precise, I managed to break it without cutting with the shards. ^p386^
very gloomy and getting musty. I use inspiration from worrying about the townsfolk, and… ^p396^
everything was so well labelled and ordered. I find some potions and a vial of antitoxin.
there is also a magic garland with what look like fresh flowers (although they shouldn’t be). it shimmers. I take it as well.
I’ll go back to The Pickled Hen. ^p391^
Solaine’s interrogation is not shedding new information.
the potion does the trick and the woman becomes stable. I show the garland and the general agreement is that it was for the wedding, and that there is some magic. we are going to present it to Maybelline’s parents. ^p376^
there is something weird going on with the parents. And it looks like there were 2 garlands. ^p374^
Roi and I take a look around the kitchen, nothing out of the ordinary except for a bunch of plants and herbs. they were in a hidden parcel behind the pantry. strange colours, and odd proportions. ^p393^
these herbs are used in rituals to contact lower planes. I want to check the garden. ^p392^
it is pretty neglected. No sign of the flowers from the garland. but I found a patch of dark soil, and buried there a parchment in Abyssal. i cannot read that. ^p385^
there is also a lock of hair. we would need to question Solaine about both findings. they are within her expertise. 
we go back to check Maybelline’s room. ^p381^
there is another garland there. they seem to attract each other, as if there were some sort of enchantment. We are running an experiment. ^p378^
an ancient love spell. if the garlands touch the spell breaks, ironic, or just twisted. ^p372^
I’m riding a pony! well, the shapeshifted druid, back to town. back to the jailhouse. I have some questions for Solaine.
p375 - the garlands. 
p382 - the hair. Tomlin’s hair. all points to an enchantment to either conquer him or break Solaine’s heart. ^p399^
p389 second night of patrol
p400
a mistery unsolved: a female figure in the dark, with simple clothes, might be the person that freed Solaine. somehow linked to a crescent moon and cold and ice. but a new cleric is now in town and I can follow my path.
