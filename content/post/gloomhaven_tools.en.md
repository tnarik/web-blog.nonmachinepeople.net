# Gloomhaven tools

I used to keep a file with references to a bunch of tools to support playing Jaws of the Lion, Gloomhaven and ideally Frosthaven. but that file is empty now (not sure what I did, probably messed up and just didn't save). regardless, this is my attempt to recreate this list as I want to complete the JotL campaing and start a new one.
