so...
p8 - p23 -p40 sprint to town chased by wolves
p4; the dwarf soosh them away. Roy Sunderhammer -p1 go to Langston
call the cleric p27 -p19 Maybelline is the name of the deceased, funeral at The Pickled Hen -p34 intimidate the drunk -p20 but I don’t manage to p36
Tanya (Mayor Anathram) the half-orc stops it p44 - p28 funeral starts. 
p32 Tomlin, the fiance speaks. it looks like his nickname is The Wolf. i’m suspecting. There is something wrong about this, maybe he’s a newcomer in the village. A womaniser, perhaps?
I tried to use my insight because this is not the place nor moment to investigate. p46
p29 yes I have a feeling that Tomlin is so kind of Don Juan and everyone in town knows that, or at least all women do. You look like Roy is about to talk now. p13
Roy is the druid assigned to Langston. something weird happened with his beard when he sneezed. 
I focused on the changes that took place. p14 - p42
if it were not impossible, I would say the druid was becoming a wolf? Might he be a werewolf or why would he change his such a strange that Tomlin’s nickname is the wolf.
The Sun cleric is going to talk now. p39

her name is Solaine. she looks like she changed as well, at least in the character. She looks more confident. p43 - p45 - did she have an affair with Tomlin? Maybe that makes her stronger and more confident? -p25
Tanya is talking now she has a giant mastiff. She used to be a soldier. She is it going to talk to me now.
p6. I focus on the dog. - p22 it is definitely a military dog -p30
she just hired me as an investigator . I got a room at the inn. will retire for the night.
p26. 

long rest (roughly an hour playing, a bit less 20230930 11:39 now)
