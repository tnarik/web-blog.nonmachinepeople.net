# a somewhat different reality

In at least one of our realities, the scoundrel and the magic user met beforehand. the circumstances are unclear but also irrelevant for this story. suffice to say that they met, and that their names are **Kasja** and **Abelgenaffar**, as they have always been. **Kasja** is a hafling with an inclination for the shadows and other peoples assets, while **Abelgenaffar** is looking towards the light both as knowledge but also in a more physical sense, after a childhood in the Underdark. in this world, they originate in the same realm, albeit in different parts of it.

this is a harsh reality, where combat is to be expected. is therefore convenient that the couple also met **Ramra** (a minotaur geared for approaching her foes fast and tearing them down to pieces) and **Niblet** (a ferocius goblin with the skills of a healer) a couple of days ago.

here, the Weave doesn't allow manipulation to enable flying or floating, just gliding down slowly instead of plummeting towards the ground, at most.

with combat a given, it is no surprising that an adventuring party must behave as a very cohesive unit: money is pooled together and given to a treasurer, rations considered for the whole party as a unit, and there are always ammunition, oil or torches when needed.
the party is generous with their magic items, but everyone is expected to be self-sufficient and "help" doesn't apply to challenges or attacks, unless it is in the form of higher help (blessings, spellcasting, etc.). first aid is different, of course.

there is no retreat in battle, just risk, strategy, fear and (hopefully) victory. 

## a new purpose

^p1^ Ramra and Niblet joined the couple when the news of Corodon being attacked were shared by a traveller in the inn they were staying at, gathering strength and information before moving forward to the temples of Noccora.

since then, in has been a long march towards Manillia (the capital) during which the party got the know each other better (they have something in common already, as they all come from Corodon), sharing their fears and their histories of the homeland. having consumed the last of the rations, they stopped for the night at the Sleeping Lion, in the village of Rover's Wend.

there is where they met archmabe Blasco Ra√ßoso, who explained the situation at home and propsoed a different (and perhaps tide turning) plan, to strike directly against the Deathless King, the founder king (Estaban Camacho) in lich form.
