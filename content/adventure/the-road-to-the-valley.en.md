# chapter 1

p8 - p23 -p40 sprint to town chased by wolves
p4; the dwarf soosh them away. Roy Sunderhammer -p1 go to Langston
call the cleric p27 -p19 Maybelline is the name of the deceased, funeral at The Pickled Hen -p34 intimidate the drunk -p20 but I don’t manage to p36
Tanya (Mayor Anathram) the half-orc stops it p44 - p28 funeral starts. 
p32 Tomlin, the fiance speaks. it looks like his nickname is The Wolf. i’m suspecting. There is something wrong about this, maybe he’s a newcomer in the village. A womaniser, perhaps?
I tried to use my insight because this is not the place nor moment to investigate. p46
p29 yes I have a feeling that Tomlin is so kind of Don Juan and everyone in town knows that, or at least all women do. You look like Roy is about to talk now. p13
Roy is the druid assigned to Langston. something weird happened with his beard when he sneezed. 
I focused on the changes that took place. p14 - p42
if it were not impossible, I would say the druid was becoming a wolf? Might he be a werewolf or why would he change his such a strange that Tomlin’s nickname is the wolf.
The Sun cleric is going to talk now. p39

her name is Solaine. she looks like she changed as well, at least in the character. She looks more confident. p43 - p45 - did she have an affair with Tomlin? Maybe that makes her stronger and more confident? -p25
Tanya is talking now she has a giant mastiff. She used to be a soldier. She is it going to talk to me now.
p6. I focus on the dog. - p22 it is definitely a military dog -p30
she just hired me as an investigator . I got a room at the inn. will retire for the night.
p26. 

long rest (roughly an hour playing, a bit less 20230930 11:39 now)

I woke up refreshed 

I got my breakfast and headed towards the town hall. as much as I care for animals, this dog is a military dog and I recognise that a battle dog, not the kind of dog eager to be pet. I greet the mayor. p21 -
she says the girl looked like she was attacked by a beast, but she was found within town, not on the outskirts or the woods. And Roi is meant to take care of keeping the woods in check (no monsters or hazards.). she is offering 320gp to take care of the thread. I don't need the money and I'm on my way to my family, but that poor girl... it doesn't seem natural. it is not as if she was mauled by wolves out of carelessness. something needs to be done. p45 (should be 48)-
Tomlin was an herbalist, as it seemed. he lives in the western part of town. I get access to the general store now. I'm not going right now, but whenever I'mn in town I can.
got an advance of 20 gp.
heading to Tomlin's. p49

\page
# chapter 2

I see the drunk from last night, people seems embarrased. good. it doesn't seem to be the common feeling of the town. p84
I got to Tomlin's cottage and decided to take a look around. He might not be a suspect (not to the villagers), but there is something fishy about the guy. plus he might not be in. p77
yep, he was hooking up with a woman already. not judgement (I don't know him), but it doesn't match last night speech. and he is acting ashamed, so he thinks he needs to pretend and knows it looks bad. none of my business, no morals here. pi5
(he says nothing, I get in to the cottage. p69
he offers some tea, I do not drink tea, I don't drink tea, but want to check it out. p54
Let's use what I know about nature. p97 - I used one inspiration, butgot a 11, so no clue. p50
let's refuse the tea, p86
he didn't have a problem with it. p80
has he seen anything strange? p62
the wolves have been more active (or loud) in the last cpuple of months.
there are also some strangers camped near Emmitt and Tilly's farm. Roi also sleeps outside, it seems (make sense for a druid).
also complains about thefts.
I also ask where he was the night of the death. p101
he kind of got angry, but quickly seems ashamed and says he was with friends, at the tarvern. a bit of a crazy night.
let me investigate p83 (because of the success)
but, where was (maybelline? p104))
 
it was a full moon and she didn't go out, she was superstitious. Tomlin was meeting a childhood friend with osme marital issues.
was it just him and friends in the tavern? 7 p74
Solaine was also there. they were lovers before her pilgrimage. while she was away, Maybelline and him fell in love.
Solaine w not so happy, but Tomlin thinks she came arouun. she would have performed the wedding. It is her or Roi
Roi was also there, and he left when he started sneezing and coughing. like during the funeral...
did Maybelline had enemies that he knows? p56
he says no, but... le me dig futher. let's persuade him (this time with the d20, not the d12 as I did for the tea... :/ ). and because this is important, used inspiration, p85
not enemies, he says, but conflicts.
she argued with Mayor Anathram, and Maybelline never argued that he knows.
and SOlaine shut herself in the tower for a while, clearly hurt. not discussions that he knows. and he didn't speak to her much then.
ok, let's wrap this convo. p62 - p105 (couldn't leave directly).
just before leaving he mentions some damage on the garden at night, clawed prints in the soil. I'll check the garden. p78
let's check the trellis of the plot p81
some plants are pretty damaged. the plot is well taken care of . well troden. I'm looking closer: p75 (used inspiration but it was not needed).
to shrubs are attacking? I wasn't expecting that. p64

there are two scraplings. humanoid like, made out of dry wook. a fight to death with one of them (Tomlin is taking care of the other).

the scrapling is faster, he attacks: 12 is less than my armour class (AC). it misses me with its claws.
I draw one of my shortswords and take a swing at the creature: 14, equal. manage to hit. 6+3, kill the thing.
I go to p88 (but I played in my head/dice if I could kill the second, even though Tomlin is engaging with it. I "imaginarily" [more] would have drawn the second shortsword, there would have been a round of missing for both, and on the third overall round, with initiative, I would have struck it down. BUT does is imagination, let's really go to p88.)

I seath the swords and take the scrapling claw that Tomlin offers me as a souvenir. that was a plant creature, maybe Roi nows about them. Evening is approaching. I 'm leaving for the inn, but Tomlin wants me to follow him inside again. p72
I'm given a vial containing philter of remembrance (10 doses). I make my way back to the inn. p106.
I get a meal, and get ready for a long rest. p93
I wake up with moonlight. it was a short reset. there is some hairy and hunched shape on a neighboring roof. it is extending an arm in my direction, waiting.
I call out to the creature, might be Roi in some weird shape. p79

golden yellow glints on the eyes. "He's mine!"" WTF? it disappears. I go out to investigate, will get my shortsword in my hand as soon as I am out. p87.
Can I climb the wall? I seath my sword. I fail my rolld, p59
no way I can climb tha, go back to stay up and keep watch. p55.
a short rest, at some point it starts to rain, it would erase all traces. some noise outside my door. p107

cold breakfast, empty common room, quiet streets. the wagon with flowers from the funeral is still outside.  I should talk to the druid. p108

(chapter 2 was about 1 h of play)

\page

# Chapter 3
this is a very quiet wood. beautiful and peaceful, but eeily quiet.  p122
I stopped in a clearing to drink some water and now looked around (7 + 4 x 2 due to the forest being my favoured terrain,… but it should have been 7 + 4  + 2 because only the proficiency bonus was doubled. I will let it pass this time) -> p155
there is a beast there. a stirge, of course. let's fight a bit! 
1st, I quickly take my bow and attack right before it turns to see me. p144
my first arrow hits, doing 8 damage and finishing the haggard stirge while it was turning towards me. p138
I take a brief rest and the woods stay as quiet as before. nothing changed. I keep going to the druid's. p150
I get there, to what looks like a cottage with almost no walls. just some simple furniture around. hold on, there is some kind of wolf in the grove. I bet this is the druid. I just walk into the grove. p156
the wolf gets into view, defensive, but not aggresive, I think. something red on it's muzzle. looks like blood. I approach it peacefully. p 110
it looks confused (I think he was trying to intimidate me a bit), I just talk to it normally, IN DWARVISH because I'm pretty sure it is Roi and I'm a dwarf. p134
yes, it can understand me. but it doesn't transform, he goes into the cabin and comes back with a wooden druid symbol. yep, this is the druid indeed. p158
"why don't you revert back? let's talk, Roi." he shakes his head. motions me to follow (I can tell by the way he  moves and waits). inside everything is quite sloppy and disarrayed. he pints with his snout to some scrolls. I go throuht them and he puts his paw on one, "Doppleganger's Curse" aka Polypiox. ah, not a werewolf then, but some disease which means he cannot control his changes. he might even get amnesia.
there is a recipe for a cure (with wolfsbane, sage and hornwort). I can get the herbs from Tomlin or from around. "are you sure it is polypox?" p 113
yep, he  is.
let me search around. p146
looking for sage. p125
no need to the double proficiency from the terrain. p109
succeess. now for some hornwort  p 120
there is a shallow pond. I search with help from Roi. p131
success! now wolfsbane. p 133
Roi helped again (and I have lived in the woods for days at a time) p154
so I collect some, carefully to avoid toxins. Roi darts to the grove. p140
I brew some tea out of the ingredients, pour it into a bowl. Roi laps his medicine. he lies down,, and I wait with him, comfortable on the ground. apparently passed via the stirge by somebody or something else. he gives me the Silverstar, a gift from Solaine's predecessor, a cleric.

Roi needs to rest, but I'll ask a couple of questions. first the scrapling claw. p163
not the killer (I didn't think so). but he transforms it into a +1 club for a week.
"before I leave, just a quick question: when did you get sick?"  p135
sniffling aoround new moon, he says, sneezing and chaging a couple of weeks later, he says. and Maybelline died on a full moon. hummm
he doesn't think he suffers amnesia. he wasn't sneezing during the full moon, aparently. today was the first change. he laughs the hint of a suspicion off.

polypox is bloodborne, he is pretty sure it was the stirge (me too, he seems sincere), not from a werewolf, but werewolves can get polypox, or just be carriers.

"Well, Roi, thanks. take care", p 124
I get back and eat, have some bad dreams about being attacked by rosebushes or running around in all fours. Also dreamt with the shape from last night. wake up startled. I don't see anything outside the window. but... I'll try to keep watch, forgot about that shape. p160
nothing happened, just that rest was short.

sun rises and there is a knock at the door. p128
the innkeeper brought a hot breakfast. Solaine has been asking for me last night and this morning. will I visit her? she asked for me to go to the temple. she thinks she can help.

oh, is this a note from the mayor? "thanks". I eat and read.  p164

there is a new lead. I'm commanded to go to the town hall.
I'm not sure I like being commanded, and I'm spending too long here instead of looking into my origins while going back to the Ephenbald farm, but... ah, hell, I also wanted more experiences. p165

(1h more or less)
\page

# Chapter 4

almost a normal day, but not really, p193
the mayor says I should go and check the strangers living outside town (I think she refers to those). they make people uncomfortable, it seems. um... p212
I think they might not be related to the murder, but might know something, and being outsiders might be more impartial. I'm not going to ask for more money. p232
bandits, she calls them now. don't think that's what they are either. ok, let's check it out. back to the forest trails. p176
a normal forest this time, it seems calm and peaceful. p215
a clearing with a dryad and a robin. I heard about this creature, didn't meet any yet. I'm not going to attack. I should sneak, that's none of my business right now.  (p168 is an errata, it should be p203).
I try to go without disturbing her, stealthy. oh, I  fail. (but p198 is an errata, as it is for a SUCCESSFUL roll. so... p230  it is).
I step on a dry twig and then a pile of dried leaves. clearly not the day to be quiet. she reacts like about to attack,, but hesitates, a spell at the ready. ok, let's talk. p200
she peaks broken Common. do I know Sylvan? I think I don't. arg. p177
it would have to do. "strings grab friends" nets? lassos? I will try to help. I'm a ranger anyway, protecting nature is my thing. gives me a potion of barkskin (a toughener of sorts). it seems the camp is empty for now (the strangers/bandits are gone for a while). ask for directions.  p195
she guides me, graceful and quiet, to an entrance point into another clearing. a firepit with trash from meals, charred bones and old porridge. not a lush clearing. this are hunters, or poachers. p182
no kindling around for tonight, it seems. something is kept outside of animals reach, hanging from a tree. but other than that is like a trashy bivouac place. I investigate thoroughly, inspired by the forest. due to the advantage, I rolled twice and got a natural crit the second roll. p207
what I see:
- a warrant made out to Horace and Titch of 100s of gp (information) or 1000s (capture dead or alive) for the Wolf of the Road, which has an Orcish name (pretty obvious it is Orciash). They killed a constable in Three Rivers. I take this with me. I guess the bandits/strangers are these "Horace" and "Titch" individuals. gear is tattered and in disrepair.
- on a second oilcloth: an agate brooch (15gp) and a flimsy jeweled dagger (5gp). p183

night is coming. days are short here, damn! I get to town with the sun set, stairs starting to shine. (a letter from/to Emmitt is mentioned, but I don't have any and a quick search doesn't seem to mention  any either. um... my version might be OLD/WRONG... I think it refers to the warrant?).
the mayor received some sealed message, she is NOT at the town hall. I get the address to her house. cool. p206
two figures (Horace and Titch, I guess) are waiting when the mayor comes. do I read some tension? they greet each other not very friendly. but go into the house together, with Horace first, and Titch last. Light illuminates the window, the door is shut. I get closer.  p197
small and neglected garden, stones and timber. angrily raised voices come from inside.
I keep listening.  p188
they are shouting, the guard dog barks. p229
they are angry, but I cannot tell anything else. I'll knock. p205
conversation goes silent. the mayor inquires who is there. who? me, is everything ok? further silence, the mayor opens the door. she seems courteous now. wtf?
I step in. the lean bandit has a dagger at her back? oh, my. the Mayor seems to ignore all the guy. what is going on?
am I a hostage? the mayor gestures me to comply. ok, but... p209
not a hosting situation, but they are menacing somehow. mayor and dog are furious but restrain themselves. hinting at...  the Mayor or one of them knowing more about the killing due to a revealed secret? oh, shit. p192
so, the Mayor is the Wolf of the Road, these guys (yes, Horace and Titch) say. they have a poster linked to the warrant I have. I say what I know: no sense threatening with reinforcements or their party (there is none), no additional proof. their gambit didn't work, the mayor is going to retaliate, I guess. I threaten them. just want them to go away and sort this out with the mayor. p199
oh, I cannot intimidate them. so p228
it is fighting time. p178
I take TItch, while the Mayor and Buttercup engage Horace.
Titch tries to swing at me with a dagger. and hits, a bit more than a glance, 4 HP.
I draw my shortsword and hit for 8HP, nice. this will end soon.
Titch hits again, 4 HP.
but now I have my two shortswords out. He dodges my first strike, but the second one hits fully, 6HP.
My part is done. p184
I don't kill Titch, the Mayor stops the fight. Horace surrenders, having thrown his knife. the Mayor has the weapon at the ready, doesn't want more fight. It might be that she was this killer, but her ways changed. I choose to believe this. and I choose to let the bandit live, the poor bastard. p231
did the stupid Horace treathen me AFTER I let his friend live? stupid guy. they leave. p191
I give what I found to the Mayor. I would expect an explanation. she says she did not kill the constable. he was alive when she escaped with Buttercup.
so, she was the leader of a band of bandits, a bandit crew. and Wolf of the Road was her name, and they operated around Three Rivers. crime after not fitting within orc nor human societies, after being a warrior.
H and T broke into the home of a resistance leader, to threaten him about making life easier for the bandits, but overdid it and beat him to death.

the Mayor didn't want to feel responsible for further deaths, and left, escaped. all this by making the bandits raid an invading force, with her disappearing in the chaos. the town assumed she was a veteran and she didn't correct them. just lied. Maybelline had found out, from H or T making noise. the Mayor thinks there was redemption or that at least she was not a murderer. that's not what Maybelline thought. p221
that's what they argued about, I think. and she is really sad and wishing for a resolution. she is also grateful. I ask for something to protect myself. p172
she gives me an amulet she was wearing around her neck, a lesser amulet of the beast. p222
what doesn't burn now should really burn. p211
her secret is safe. Buttercup is licking my palm. I'll earn this dog trust. back to the inn, I need some rest. p202
completely empty streets, a single long and low howl. already cold dinner, going to bed with a faint howl in the distance. p236

(1h30')
this will be a long rest, more on that later.

(7 hours later, at 5:30 AM) but before going to bed I study the amulet and the silverbane, reflecting on both the fight from tonight and the druid sickness. I attuned. and then go to bed, having a good and relaxing night and recovering fully. breakfast is ready as well as a note of gratitude from the mayor. The funeral will be tomorrow, so I better go to the temple to inspect the body. and talk to Solaine, which is well overdue. p237

# Chapter 5

the sun temple is old, a limestone building seemingly predating the town. I got in, but there is nobody around. I’ll explore. p296

from the central hall I head towards the dining hall. they might be having breakfast. p267

let’s explore the dining room further. p277

nothing. the kitchen perhaps? p280

a single setting of cutlery’s and plates. is Solaine the only one here? the kitchen is windowless, the dining room had 5 tables with 8 seats each. the stove is not used very much (rusty), but there is ash around the door. umm p244
there us some fabric or clothing charred remains.  let’s see. p269

p255
these are burned holy vestments. not in good condition before burning. seams burst, one cuff has blood? droplets. it crumbles

what is there in the larder? p310

forgotten food: veggies, potatoes, bread. moldy and wilted. but fresh meat, plenty of it. with… small bite marks? I “smell” werewolf. back to the front hall. p296

up north towards the library. p258

pretty large, books and scrolls on one table. nobody. religious texts and some history tomes. something about treaty common curses. also a black book with a title not in Common, bound with skin other than a leather. and a metal lock open. 
let’s check the book on curses. p281
“Compendium of Curses 17th Edition”, with descriptions of curses, diagrams of wards and sections with cures. what was the cleric reading about? p 288
on a page with Lwelyn’s face and lycanthropy there is a sheet with a note. elegant calligraphy but some words are crossed out and there are small marks of… tears? A letter to Tomlin, I believe. “a truly changed woman’, mentions to a darkness blooming, and it is unfinished. Leave the letter where it is. p279
what about the black book? p314
sharkskin? brimstone smell and oily touch. I don’t think I can understand this book.p249
black sun, weapons, sharp  tools, study of corpses or bones. a note  (“This one”) on an entry with images of animated corpses?. I go back, p296

living quarters, p245

30 room, 6 on each side + 1. only the one on the far end is closed. skylighted hall,, morning sunshine. dusty. let’s check the area (I’m investigating, of course). p240
p287
do not really see anything. I knock, p253.
nothing. open and walk in. p302
not empty, sparse. check before and table. p311
neat, do not  think it was used recently. there  is also an envelope, opened many times already. I will check this. p242
A love letter: A Thyme  for Love in the Sun, by Tomlin,, to Solaine. very bad poem. returned and look  at the wardrobe. p275
religious vestments, one very repaired, very recently. some gap between it and the wall. let’s see, p299
even though I’m weak in general, it looks like I’m strong enough to push the closet aside. perhaps because of the very good rest from last night. p238
I retrieve a ribbon. p247
a lavender strip of silk. bloodstained. lavender was a favourite of Maybelline.

I go back to the hall. p296
and wait for Solaine. p270
waiting is  so dumb. let’s check the…  golden floor mosaic. p243
there are no tiles. it looks like a single  stone (or magic). there  is some  indentation on the central holy symbol. gnome hand size, the shape  of a smaller  sunburst.  umm. p241
I investigate. p283
no clue. let’s press on it. p303
ups, some  magic build up. I manage to dodge the  light, but it feels like it could have hurt a bit. the  seam disappears, it looks like something got back into place, the opening is hidden now. oh, my. let’s see the tapestries. p290

they depict the holy order raising the temple and banishing the undead. darkness and the undead devouring people, holy figures appearing, a ring formation and light striking, a ring of green plants and blue skies. with a band of black earth and floating dark red eyes. waiting. does it remind me of anything? p309

p257
this is an ancient order of sun worshippers. 100s or 1000s  of years ago. while the order has a presence (even one) and dedication to the light, the area is protected. do not remember more. I’ll just have to wait longer. p294

she finally returns to the temple. hem of the robe soiled black, some soil clumps falling  from her slippers. I startled her.p268
she is alone here perhaps overwhelmed but acting as if it is ok. big smiles. 
what about the undead? p248
Tomlin? p315
is common knowledge. she doesn’t  hide the story.
ok, let’s check the body. p289
she says I cannot. why? p295
p254

see  seems  afraid. not sure  what from. she says it is out of concern about the family,  not fear. ok. but I can check. p293
I  go alone, to the cemetery,, entering from the north. a  bright day. the mausoleum is  in the center of the graveyard. uh-oh, a grave with some black earth, but not dug up? undead? let’s check, do not want to risk a surprise while investigating. p264
dug from underneath.  a person dead for decades. a crack in its skull and a broken piece of paving half-buried in the dark soil (the unusually dark soil). seems  thrown there.

check  Maybelline, what a morning. p276
oh, Maybelline is reanimated. will have to fight her. p286
I’m faster, move back within the mausoleum and  take my bow, readying an arrow. 9 HP. I move further to put distance between us, making her come out, I think I’m faster. it approaches and remains 5 feet away. 
I now do the same thing again, putting distance in between and sending an arrow her way. see is pretty weak now, it seems. comes near me, still not within reach. I drop the bow and get a sword out, ready for the next attack.  but there is a burst of movement  and she gets next to me, slamming  me. ups,  that hurt! I swing my sword, 2HP to go. 
take  my second sword out, attack. and done. p297
for a second it looks like that last blow might not  really do it, but  after some last death rattle (undeath rattle?) she drops dead. again? p246
look at that. p262
I recover  my  bow and one arrow. the other one broke.
the previous wounds seem inflicted by a wild animal. broad  and deep claw marks. not very forest beast like. a rage driven attack based on the patterns and random look. I look at the bouquet of pink flowers she dropped. p307
the only flowers I see around, with a tag signed by Tomlin. daisies in the mix. p250
ah, Solaine is still there. I think she has doubts about her  faith, and she is not paying attention to me. I need to interrupt her, p306
yep, I’ll tell the mayor. to me, Solaine is not a member of the order any more. or not a dedicated one. but… well, I leave. she goes back to the library. p252

I’ll go on patrol, I can take a rest before that, recovering from the fight. and ready to go. p301
no zombies or ghouls. but two body remains, torn apart it seems. same kind of wounds as Maybelline had. I come back in the wee hours, and fall asleep. 
no food at the door, but the mayor is having breakfast waiting for me. in  the common  area. p317
