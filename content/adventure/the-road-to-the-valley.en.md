# chapter 1

p8 - p23 -p40 sprint to town chased by wolves
p4; the dwarf soosh them away. Roy Sunderhammer -p1 go to Langston
call the cleric p27 -p19 Maybelline is the name of the deceased, funeral at The Pickled Hen -p34 intimidate the drunk -p20 but I don’t manage to p36
Tanya (Mayor Anathram) the half-orc stops it p44 - p28 funeral starts. 
p32 Tomlin, the fiance speaks. it looks like his nickname is The Wolf. i’m suspecting. There is something wrong about this, maybe he’s a newcomer in the village. A womaniser, perhaps?
I tried to use my insight because this is not the place nor moment to investigate. p46
p29 yes I have a feeling that Tomlin is so kind of Don Juan and everyone in town knows that, or at least all women do. You look like Roy is about to talk now. p13
Roy is the druid assigned to Langston. something weird happened with his beard when he sneezed. 
I focused on the changes that took place. p14 - p42
if it were not impossible, I would say the druid was becoming a wolf? Might he be a werewolf or why would he change his such a strange that Tomlin’s nickname is the wolf.
The Sun cleric is going to talk now. p39

her name is Solaine. she looks like she changed as well, at least in the character. She looks more confident. p43 - p45 - did she have an affair with Tomlin? Maybe that makes her stronger and more confident? -p25
Tanya is talking now she has a giant mastiff. She used to be a soldier. She is it going to talk to me now.
p6. I focus on the dog. - p22 it is definitely a military dog -p30
she just hired me as an investigator . I got a room at the inn. will retire for the night.
p26. 

long rest (roughly an hour playing, a bit less 20230930 11:39 now)

I woke up refreshed 

I got my breakfast and headed towards the town hall. as much as I care for animals, this dog is a military dog and I recognise that a battle dog, not the kind of dog eager to be pet. I greet the mayor. p21 -
she says the girl looked like she was attacked by a beast, but she was found within town, not on the outskirts or the woods. And Roi is meant to take care of keeping the woods in check (no monsters or hazards.). she is offering 320gp to take care of the thread. I don't need the money and I'm on my way to my family, but that poor girl... it doesn't seem natural. it is not as if she was mauled by wolves out of carelessness. something needs to be done. p45 (should be 48)-
Tomlin was an herbalist, as it seemed. he lives in the western part of town. I get access to the general store now. I'm not going right now, but whenever I'mn in town I can.
got an advance of 20 gp.
heading to Tomlin's. p49

# chapter 2

I see the drunk from last night, people seems embarrased. good. it doesn't seem to be the common feeling of the town. p84
I got to Tomlin's cottage and decided to take a look around. He might not be a suspect (not to the villagers), but there is something fishy about the guy. plus he might not be in. p77
yep, he was hooking up with a woman already. not judgement (I don't know him), but it doesn't match last night speech. and he is acting ashamed, so he thinks he needs to pretend and knows it looks bad. none of my business, no morals here. pi5
(he says nothing, I get in to the cottage. p69
he offers some tea, I do not drink tea, I don't drink tea, but want to check it out. p54
Let's use what I know about nature. p97 - I used one inspiration, butgot a 11, so no clue. p50
let's refuse the tea, p86
he didn't have a problem with it. p80
has he seen anything strange? p62
the wolves have been more active (or loud) in the last cpuple of months.
there are also some strangers camped near Emmitt and Tilly's farm. Roi also sleeps outside, it seems (make sense for a druid).
also complains about thefts.
I also ask where he was the night of the death. p101
he kind of got angry, but quickly seems ashamed and says he was with friends, at the tarvern. a bit of a crazy night.
let me investigate p83 (because of the success)
but, where was (maybelline? p104))
 
it was a full moon and she didn;t go out, she was superstitious. Tomlin was meeting a childhood friend with osme marital issues.
was it just him and friends in the tavern? 7 p74
Solaine was also there. they were lovers before her pilgrimage. while she was away, Maybelline and him fell in love.
Solaine w not so happy, but Tomlin thinks she came arouun. she would have performed the wedding. It is her or Roi
Roi was also there, and he left when he started sneezing and coughing. like during the funeral...
did Maybelline had enemies that he knows? p56
he says no, but... le me dig futher. let's persuade him (this time with the d20, not the d12 as I did for the tea... :/ ). and because this is important, used inspiration, p85
not enemies, he says, but conflicts.
she argued with Mayor Anathram, and Maybelline never argued that he knows.
and SOlaine shut herself in the tower for a while, clearly hurt. not discussions that he knows. and he didn't speak to her much then.
ok, let's wrap this convo. p62 - p105 (couldn't leave directly).
just before leaving he mentions some damage on the garden at night, clawed prints in the soil. I'll check the garden. p78
let's check the trellis of the plot p81
some plants are pretty damaged. the plot is well taken care of . well troden. I'm looking closer: p75 (used inspiration but it was not needed).
to shrubs are attacking? I wasn't expecting that. p64

there are two scraplings. humanoid like, made out of dry wook. a fight to death with one of them (Tomlin is taking care of the other).

the scrapling is faster, he attacks: 12 is less than my armour class (AC). it misses me with its claws.
I draw one of my shortswords and take a swing at the creature: 14, equal. manage to hit. 6+3, kill the thing.
I go to p88 (but I played in my head/dice if I could kill the second, even though Tomlin is engaging with it. I "imaginarily" [more] would have drawn the second shortsword, there would have been a round of missing for both, and on the third overall round, with initiative, I would have struck it down. BUT does is imagination, let's really go to p88.)

I seath the swords and take the scrapling claw that Tomlin offers me as a souvenir. that was a plant creature, maybe Roi nows about them. Evening is approaching. I 'm leaving for the inn, but Tomlin wants me to follow him inside again. p72
I'm given a vial containing philter of remembrance (10 doses). I make my way back to the inn. p106.
I get a meal, and get ready for a long rest. p93
I wake up with moonlight. it was a short reset. there is some hairy and hunched shape on a neighboring roof. it is extending an arm in my direction, waiting.
I call out to the creature, might be Roi in some weird shape. p79

golden yellow glints on the eyes. "He's mine!"" WTF? it disappears. I go out to investigate, will get my shortsword in my hand as soon as I am out. p87.
Can I climb the wall? I seath my sword. I fail my rolld, p59
no way I can climb tha, go back to stay up and keep watch. p55.
a short rest, at some point it starts to rain, it would erase all traces. some noise outside my door. p107

cold breakfast, empty common room, quiet streets. the wagon with flowers from the funeral is still outside.  I should talk to the druid. p108

(chapter 2 was about 1 h of play)
