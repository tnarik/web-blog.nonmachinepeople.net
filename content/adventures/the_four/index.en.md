# The First Four

## Intro

I've been wanting to play some solo RPGs for a while now, and I've been doing it in some fashion by playing around with game books, fantasy based 1 player tabletop (or traytop) games, and some scripted solo adventures (like Obvious Mimic or Archmage Press 5e solo adventures). some of those plays are more thorough than others, while some are more paused, depending on the time I have.

what I was planning on trying for some time is a simplified unscripted dungeon crawler (not exactly an RPG, except in the OSR sense of it, as represented by `pedit5`, which [I talked about before]({{< relref "posts/crpg-archaeology" >}}) )

I started looking into it a long time ago, reading and re-reading the book (or portions of it), but now I am finally pushing for a first run. with already selected character names and archetypes from some months ago (during a trip or perhaps a break from climbing), the only thing pending is to start playing. for this, I printed some pages and booklets at work, and I will also keep track of some information here, at least as snapshots for the initial setup.

putting all the information together and finally rolling some dice, the party characters look like this: 

{{monster,frame
## Farluk Farduk
*Wizzard (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 2 + L
***Wealth*** :: 16 (4d6)
___
***amor*** :: None.
***weapons*** :: Light weapon, sling.
___
***attacks.*** :: L only added to attack rolls from spells (including scrolls).
***puzzles.*** :: L added to rolls to solve puzzles and riddles.
***spellcasting.*** :: A wizard begins with 2 + L spells. They should prepare then before starting the adventure (multiple copies are allowed). Additional spells (found or from leveling up), may be used immediately.  
### Spells
***as*** ::
### Items
***light hand weapon.*** :: walking stick.
***spell book.*** ::
***writing tools.*** ::
}}

**Farluk** is the main spellcaster of the party. I went for a very traditional setup because the main thing for the first game(s) is to learn the mechanics, see if it is something for me, and have fun.

{{monster,frame
## Clovenia
*Warrior (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 6 + L
***Wealth*** :: 11 (2d6)
___
***amor*** :: Shield, light armour, heavy armour.
***weapons*** :: Any.
___
***attacks.*** :: L added to attack rolls.
### Items
***light armour.*** :: reinforced leather vest, pants and boots.
***shield.*** :: a heavy wooden shield, reinforced with metal bars and padded with fur.
***hand weapon.*** :: a fairly used broadsword.
}}

a warrior seems straightforward enough, with barely any decisions to make regarding their build. she will be the main damage dealer and tank, I guess.

{{monster,frame
## Ardanmalusa
*Cleric (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 4 + L
***Wealth*** :: 2 (d6)
___
***amor*** :: Shield, light armour, heavy armour.
***weapons*** :: Hand weapon, two-handed weapon, sling.
___
***attacks.*** :: L/2 added to attack rolls. L added against undead.
***spellcasting.*** :: Cast Blessing up to 3 times. Cast Healing (d6 + L life points) up to three times. When casting from scrolls, L is only added to Blessing, otherwise, as level 1.
### Items
***light armour.*** :: leather armour.
***shield.*** :: a metal shield with an engraved sigil.
***hand weapon.*** :: a silver metal rod.
}}

not having played yet, I cannot tell, but having some healing capabilities is a good idea in general. this is a similar composition to what I used for EOB.

{{monster,frame
## Pettic
*Roque (Level 1)*
___
***Live*** :: 3 + L
***Wealth*** :: 5 (3d6)
___
***amor*** :: Light armour.
***weapons*** :: Light weapon, sling.
___
***attacks.*** :: L added to disarm traps and defense. L added to attack rolls against outnumbered minions only.

### Items
***rope.*** :: can be used to tie monsters.
***lock picks.*** ::
***light armour.*** :: leather armour.
***light hand weapon.*** :: a long blade dagger.
}}

and finally my rogue (because rogues rule). the name comes from *Pyramids*, which was the book I was reading at the time (during that flight or ride, not sure what it was).

we are now almost ready to play.

## Enter the dungeon
